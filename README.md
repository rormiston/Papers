# Papers

This is a short collection of papers and presentations, with the exception being *Building QFT* which is a set of notes on quantum field theory which I compiled in order to more deeply explore, understand and appreciate the subject. I believe it to be self-contained and anyone is free to use it as they see fit. Please feel free to report any errors that you may stumble across.
