# Papers

This is a short collection of papers, presentations and useful equation sheets. The exception to this being *Building QFT* which is a set of notes on quantum field theory which I compiled in order to more deeply explore, understand and appreciate the subject. I believe it to be self-contained and anyone is free to use it as they see fit. I develop my own notation which has an admittedly fairly terse explanation. However, *I think* it adds brevity without subtracting clatiry so I've kept it in (your wrists will thank you!). Please feel free to report any errors that you may stumble across.
