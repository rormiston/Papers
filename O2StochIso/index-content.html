<h1>Searching for a Gravitational Wave Background During Advanced LIGO's Second Observing Run</h1>

<p align="justify">

<p>The <a href="http://www.ligo.org/science/GW-Stochastic.php">stochastic gravitational wave background</a>
is the superposition of a large number of unresolvable gravitational waves. These waves could
originate from astrophysical sources like binary black holes
(<a href="http://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW150914Astro/index.php">GW150914</a>),
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova">supernovae</a>,
and binary neutron stars
(<a href="https://www.ligo.org/detections/GW170817.php">GW170817</a>), or they make come from cosmological
sources such as
<a href="https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-O1CosmicStrings/index.php">cosmic strings</a>.
There may be more sources that contribute to this stochastic background. It is possible that there are low density bubbles
in the early universe which rapidly expanded and created gravitational waves,
and small ripples which formed in the first moments of the universe and expanded during inflation and created waves which might
be detectable as the characteristic
<a href="http://www.ligo.org/science/GW-Stochastic.php">hiss</a>
of the stochastic gravitational wave background which encodes secrets of our cosmic history. These more exotic contributions 
to the background are harder to measure and may remain hidden until more advanced detectors begin taking data. Since the further away we look,
the further back in time we see, this distant glow of gravitational waves could tell us something about the Universe as it was billions of years ago.
</p>

<p>
To better understand the stochastic background we can use the following analogy:
Imagine looking at the headlights of cars at night. When 
the car is close, the headlights can be individually resolved. But at large distances, the headlights
begin to blur together and form a single bright spot. Similarly, we expect distant binary black holes and
binary neutron stars to merge, stars to explode as supernovae and all together these phenomenally energetic events to
create a "glow" of gravitational waves in the distance. </p>


<p>
The search for the stochastic gravitational wave background during Advanced LIGO's second run (November 2016 - August 2017) did not
yet reveal any evidence of the background. However, thanks to the increase in sensitivity of the detector due to hardware and software
<a href="http://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-O1Noise/index.php">upgrades</a>,
new upper limits could be placed on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density">energy density</a> of the background. This showed an increase in sensitivty by a factor of
about 3 relative to the
<a href="http://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-O1StochIso/index.php">first observing run</a> with Advanced LIGO. In addition to the improved upper limits on the 
stochastic background, we were also able to place new limits on the string tension in Nambu-Goto
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_string">cosmic strings</a>
and to test predictions of 
General Relativity (GR) itself. Since GR says that gravitational waves should be tensors, we can test the data find the 'odds' that Nature also
produces vector and scalar modes of gravitational wave signals. This analysis showed that the Non-GR modes (vector and scalar) are not evident in the data, meaning that
Einstein's theory still has not been shown to be in error. 
</p>

<p> A unique challenge on the horizon for the search for the stochastic background comes from magnetic noise due to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances">Schumann resonances</a>. Between the surface of the Earth and up into the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere">ionosphere</a>,
electromagnetic modes which span very large distances are generated. This leads to sustained noise that is coherent between the two
detectors. This noise contribution was too small to be an issue for this run, but at design sensitivity, 
magnetic noise may begin to limit the sensitivity of the interferometers to a stochastic gravitational-wave background and therefore needs to be carefully handeled.

its third observing run (O3), thanks to even more upgrades leading to better sensitivties, we expect to observe more events than ever before. Stay tuned for
the exciting news as O3 unfolds!

<h2>Glossary</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Black Hole:</b> A massive, dense object, whose gravitational pull is so strong that light cannot escape.</li>
<li><b>Neutron star:</b> An extremely dense remnant from the collapse of more massive stars.</li>
<li><b>Sensitivity:</b> A description of a detector's ability to detect a signal. Detectors with lower noise are able to detect weaker signals and therefore are said to have higher (or greater) sensitivity.</li>
<li><b>Noise:</b> Fluctuation in the gravitational-wave measurement signal due to various instrumental and environmental effects. The sensitivity of a gravitational-wave detector is limited by noise.</li>
<li><b>Correlation:</b> A measure of the similarity of two (or more) sets of data. If the data from two separate gravitational wave detectors
is found to be correlated, this may indicate the presence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (provided other possible sources of correlation
are ruled out).</li>
<li><b>Cosmic Microwave Background:</b> In Big Bang cosmology, thermal radiation left over from the time of recombination, the era when the universe had cooled sufficiently for neutral hydrogen to form - the afterglow of the beginning of the universe. </li>
<li><b>frequency:</b> The number of cycles per unit time. 
<li><b>observing run:</b> A period of time during which observational data is collected. </li>
<li><b>stochastic:</b> Inherently random, and therefore impossible to predict exactly.

Sensitivity curves for O1, combined O1+O2, and design sensitivity. A power law stochastic background which lies
tangent to one of these curves is detectable with 2 sigma significance. We have used the Advanced LIGO design sensitivity which incorporates improved measurements of
coating thermal noise. We note that design sensitivity assumes that the LIGO noise curve is determined by fundamental noise sources only. The purple line is the median total
stochastic background, combining BBH and BNS, using the
model with updated mass distributions and rates, and the gray box is the Poisson error region. The dotted gray line is the sum of the upper limit for the
BBH+BNS backgrounds with the upper limit on the BHNS background.

Conservative estimate of correlated magnetic noise.
We assume a conservative transfer function (TF) based on
measurements as described in the text. The first Schumann
resonance at 8 Hz is visible, higher harmonics are below the
noise floor. There is a zero of the overlap function at 64 Hz
which leads to an apparent feature in the magnetic energy density. Power line harmonics have been removed, as in the cross-correlation analysis. The two trend lines show power law fits to the magnetometer spectra, scaled by the O1 (purple dotted) and end-ofO2 (blue dot-dashed) transfer functions. This demonstrates
the effect of reducing the magnetic coupling in O2. The trend
for the noise budget lies well below the solid black O2 PI
curve, which indicates that correlated magnetic noise is negligible in O2. However magnetic contamination may be an
issue in future observing runs.
