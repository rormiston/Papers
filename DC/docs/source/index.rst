Welcome to DeepClean's documentation!
=====================================
This repository takes a deep learning approach to solving nonlinear regression
problems. Specifically, it aims to filter the nonlinear noise which couples
into DARM. 

This code is built on top of Tensorflow_ using Keras_. For questions, bug
reporting or requests about functionalities to include, email
