# DeepClean
This repository takes a deep learning approach to solving nonlinear regression
problems. Specifically, it aims to filter the nonlinear noise which couples
into DARM. **For more information, including installation instructions
and examples, visit the** [docs](https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~rich.ormiston/DeepClean/docs/build/html/index.html)

This code is built on top of [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
using [Keras](https://keras.io/). For questions, bug reporting or requests about
functionalities to include, email Rich Ormiston at rich.ormiston@ligo.org
